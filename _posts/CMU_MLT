# Academics
The School of Computer Science (SCS) in CMU has 7 departments: Computer Science (CSD),	Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII),	Institute for Software Research (ISR),	Computational Biology Department,	Language Technologies Institute (LTI),	Machine Learning (ML),	Robotics Institute (RI).
Each department has their own Masters and PhD Program.

In this post, I am talking about one of the Masters Program in Language Technologies Institute (LTI) called Masters of Language Technology (MLT).
MLT is a 2-year research-based Masters program unlike most other professional Masters program. This program is comparable to the first 2 years of a PhD program. Each MLT student has a research advisor, and supposed to dedicate 20 hours to research every week. Your summer will be devoted entirely to research. Students mostly get funded (everyone I know is funded in the last 2 years), but that's not guaranteed. Although, this is an LTI program, you don't necessarily need to work with an LTI professor. You need to complete only 9 courses in 4 semesters. 

Pros:
1) Funded (Most likely)
2) Good for continuing to a PhD, equally good for going to industry as well

Cons:
1) This program takes full 2 years. You can get a professional Masters in CMU in 16 months.
2) You need to do research even if you don't want to.
