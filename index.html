# Apping Resource
While Apping seems a very weird verb, it is a slang reference to the process of applications to graduate programs. While current  graduate students have had the opportunity to get advice from their seniors on the nitty gritties of this process and so do the current applicants, this information is often incomplete and requires a lot of effort (and often long waiting times for replies). In particular, since many online resources help towards the general application process, the advice sought is often university and/or program specific. So a bunch of us thought we would pool in our perspectives to create a resource where it is easy to find program specific information. It is an FAQ of sorts based on whatever each of us has been personally asked so far.
